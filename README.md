# Terminal Rickroll

Simple threaded Python Rickroll server. Listens on port 23 by default.

Rickroll video made using [Video-To-Ascii](https://github.com/joelibaceta/video-to-ascii) and the standard rickroll video from YouTube.

***Note:*** *This was made very quickly and is currently very barebones -- it may be improved later depending on my (admittedly disturbing) commitment to rickrolling people.*

## To-Do:
 - [ ] Add Metrics
 - [ ] Find a better way to serve the rickroll rather than the huge array import...
 - [ ] Try to improve video quality
 - [ ] Add a service file / Install script
